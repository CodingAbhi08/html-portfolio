<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a Software Developer at Regions Bank, where I focus on building scalable, high-performing applications that enhance user experience and business efficiency. 
   My work involves developing and maintaining full-stack solutions, optimizing backend performance, and collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver reliable, secure software systems.
   I'm passionate about clean architecture, problem-solving, and continuous learning to stay ahead in evolving technologies.</p>

<p>I earned my Master's degree in Computer Science from Texas Tech University, where I developed a strong foundation
 in software engineering, databases, and cloud technologies. My coursework and projects helped me gain practical experience 
 in designing distributed systems, data pipelines, and modern web applications—bridging theory with hands-on implementation.</p>

<p>Beyond coding, I enjoy exploring emerging technologies, experimenting with side projects, and contributing to open-source communities.
  I also love traveling, watching tech documentaries, and playing strategy-based games that challenge my analytical thinking and creativity.</p>
